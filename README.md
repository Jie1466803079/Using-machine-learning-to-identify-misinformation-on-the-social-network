# Using-machine-learning-to-identify-misinformation-on-the-social-network
I led a project about using machine-learning-to-identify-misinformation-on-the-social-network. Our primary objective was to discern and rectify misclassifications between human and non-human profiles. We utilized 'Twitter_user_data' as our foundational dataset. A suite of algorithms—including logistic regression, association rules, clustering, classification, and text processing—were deployed to validate profiles mistakenly labelled as 'human' when they were in fact brands, and vice versa. Our goal was not only to predict the accurate classification for each profile but also to offer concrete recommendations for rectifying any mislabeling between human and non-human categories.
