# Using-machine-learning-to-identify-misinformation-on-the-social-network
**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This project is about using machine learning to identify misinformation on the social network. Our primary objective was to discern and rectify misclassifications between human and non-human profiles. I utilized 'Twitter_user_data' as the foundational dataset. A suite of algorithms including logistic regression, association rules, clustering, classification, and text processing, were deployed to validate profiles mistakenly labelled as 'human' when they were in fact brands, and vice versa. My goal was not only to predict the accurate classification for each profile but also to offer concrete recommendations for rectifying any mislabeling between human and non-human categories.

**ROLE**

I led a six-member team in this Project.
